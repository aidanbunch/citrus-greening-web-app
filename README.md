# Citrus Greening Web Application
This repository contains a web application that uses machine learning to classify citrus trees as diseased or healthy. The machine learning model was trained using transfer learning and the FastAI library and deployed using their template. The backend of the application is written in Python, while the frontend uses typical HTML/JavaScript. This project is a testament to my early interest in machine learning and was completed during my freshman year of high school.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Docker installed.
3. Run this command in your terminal: `docker build -t fastai-v3 . && docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 fastai-v3`
